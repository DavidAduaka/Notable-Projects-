# Notable Projects

## The purpose of this repository is to showcase some of my notable projects from my time in the Columbia University data analytics bootcamp. 

## [School District Analysis](https://davidaduaka.github.io/School_District_Analysis/):

- Utilized JupyterNotebook to analyze standardized test data for reporting, presentation, and to provide insights about performance trends and patterns.

## [Pewlett Hackard Analysis](https://davidaduaka.github.io/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/):

- Utilized PostGreSQLto query through employee data to help PewlettHackarddetermine how many of its employees are retirement eligible. Secondly, what positions will  become vacant so that it can adequately plan to fill them in the future.
